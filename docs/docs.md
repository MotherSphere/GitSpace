# Docs

This folder stores high-level documentation for GitSpace. Use it for architecture overviews, design decisions, and integration notes (including Rust and .NET interoperability plans).

## Contents
- Architecture sketches and diagrams.
- Design rationales for the GitKraken-inspired interface.
- Layout and navigation maturity notes in `gitkraken-layout.md`.
- Notes on cross-platform considerations and dependency choices.

## Maintenance
Add new documents here as the project evolves, keeping the contents concise and focused on how the system should be structured or extended.
