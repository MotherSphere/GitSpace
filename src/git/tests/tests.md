# `src/git/tests/`

Test harness for the Git integration layer.

## Purpose
- Exercise git workflows end-to-end with real repositories or fixtures.
- Cover edge cases around branch operations, status detection, and history queries.

## Maintenance
- Add scenarios when introducing new git commands or error handling rules.
- Keep tests isolated and cleanup any temporary repositories they create.
