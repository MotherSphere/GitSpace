# Tasks and Folder Conventions

This document tracks work items and records the documentation conventions for GitSpace.

## Folder Documentation Convention
- Every project folder must include a Markdown file named after the folder itself.
  - Examples:
    - `tasks/` → `tasks/tasks.md`
    - `docs/` → `docs/docs.md`
    - future `config/` → `config/config.md`
    - future `ui/` → `ui/ui.md`
- Each folder-specific Markdown file must describe:
  - the purpose of the folder,
  - what kind of files it contains,
  - important notes for maintenance and future extensions.

## Current Tasks
- Define the GitKraken-inspired GUI layout and component structure.
- Explore Rust/.NET interoperability options for UI or specialized library reuse.
- Plan repository discovery, browsing, and cloning workflows with user-friendly defaults.
- Draft automated setup hooks for repositories (e.g., post-clone scripts or guided prompts).
